# Problem-Solving Exercise assignments (PSEs) are assignments to practice problem-solving skills.

# Learning Goals-- PSEs will teach us:
    # How to go from word problem to code
    # How to word the same idea in different ways
    # How to ask the right questions
    # What to consider when identifying nominal and edge cases
    # How to breakdown an alogirithm into smaller pieces
    # How to work with ambiguity
    
# We demonstrate how we think like a programmer by:
    # Sharing our understanding of the problem
    # Asking the right questions
    # Talking about coding concepts in multiple different ways
    # Solving small coding problems while working towards a bigger solution


# The exercises will touch on problem-solving skills on coding problems. The format has three parts:

    # 1. A problem statement describing the code you need to write
    
    # 2. A series of prompts to guide your understanding of the problem and scaffold our solution.
        # i. Ask at least three clarifying questions.
        # ii. Write example input/output and unit tests for at least one nominal and one edge case.
        # iii. Break down the problem into logical steps.
    # 3. A code challenge to solve the problem


# Clarifying questions and their answers give us constraints. Clarifying questions:

    # Make a problem (and its solution) smaller and clearer

    # Confirm or reject any assumptions

# Summarized Steps- breaking down a problem
    # Read the problem
    # Clarify the problem
    # Create sub-problems
    # Hypothesize ideas for the solution
    # Solve a sub-problem. When programming, this is where we write code!
    # Repeat steps necessary
    
# ========================================== CREATE LOGICAL STEPS ==========================================

# Without writing code, describe how you would implement get_highest_rating 
# in enough detail that someone else could write the code.

# It may be helpful to break up the problem/algorithm into smaller subproblems/algorithms. For example, 
    # 1. Handle invalid input, 
    # 2. Given valid input, perform the computation/solve the problem/etc.

# Your logical steps could take the form of:
    # a numbered list, 
    # pseudo code, 
    # or anywhere inbetween. 

# What's important at this stage is to think through and outline the implementation before writing code.
