# Imagine we are working on a research study 
# that studies what color t-shirts people wear on Tuesdays. 

# We've collected data on people passing by through the market, 
# and the t-shirts we see per hour.

# Given this data, create two data structures.

# The first data structure should represent the data in the table below. 

# Table:

# Time Of Day	    T-shirts colors seen
# 08:00	            red, orange, green
# 09:00	            red, orange
# 10:00	            blue
# 11:00	            blue, green
# 12:00	            blue, gray
# 13:00	            red, blue
# 14:00	            white
# 15:00	            green, white
# 16:00	            white, black
# 17:00	            yellow, black
# 18:00	            white, green, gray, red, blue

# The second data structure should represent 
# the frequency of the color t-shirts at the end of Tuesday.


# For this problem statement, the ideal solution is to create two dictionaries

# The first dictionary should have the time as the key, and the t-shirt colors seen in a list as the value.

# The second dictionary should have a t-shirt color as the key, and the frequency of that t-shirt color as the value.
