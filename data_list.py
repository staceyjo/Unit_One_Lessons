# Compare these two sequences of DNA, which contain many pieces of DNA. They are similar, but not the same, based on the order and value of each piece. These two sequences are the same length.

list_one = ["GAGCCTACTAACGGGAT"]

list_two = ["CATCGTAATGACGGCCT"]

# Create a function. In this function:

# Make a list that contains all the differences between the two sequences.
    # Find the differences between the two sequences.
    # Add each difference to the list of differences.
    
    # 1)"Compare these two sequences"--- lists are ordered.  2)"order and value of each piece"--- the value of each piece can be accessed by the index  3) "sequences are the same length" --- lists have a property of length
